# COVID-19-Trend-Prediction-Machine-Learning
In this project, I focused on forecasting COVID-19 case trends across multiple countries using different time-series models to identify the most accurate forecasting approach.

## Project Overview

- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **feature selection** to identify key factors influencing case trends.  
- Split the dataset into **training and testing sets** for performance evaluation.  
- Created data visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**, including heatmaps, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and KDE plots for in-depth data understanding.  
- Trained and compared multiple time-series models such as **AR**, **MA**, **ARIMA**, **SARIMAX**, and **Facebook Prophet**.  
- Evaluated model performance and concluded that the **FBProphet model** delivered the most accurate and reliable forecasts of COVID-19 case trends.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels**, **FBProphet**

## Results

- FBProphet achieved the most accurate predictions among all models tested.
- Provided clear insights into case growth patterns and trends across different countries.
